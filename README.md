## How to play

Your the game takes place in a virtual 2D-world. Your program reads this 2D
world from a JSON object.

receives a new JSON object with the current state of the 2D-world.

At the end of every turn, your program sends a JSON command telling your
monkey what to do next. The computation time during each turn is limited, use
it wisely.
