# Monkey Music: Core

Game engine for (Monkey Music Challenge)[http://monkeymusicchallenge.com].

## Introduction

Monkey Music Challenge is an AI- and pathfinding programming competition, where
you write a program to control a monkey. Your objective is to explore a
virtual 2D-djungle inhabited by other monkeys.

## How to play

Your monkey exists in a 2D-world. Your program reads this 2D world from a
JSON object.

The game is turn based. Every turn, your program sends a JSON command, telling
your monkey what to do next. At the start of every turn, your program
receives a new JSON object with the current state of the 2D-world.
